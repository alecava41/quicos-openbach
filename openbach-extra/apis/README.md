# OpenBACH API

Three tools are available in the API:

  * [Scenario builder](scenario_builder/README.md): is a Python package allowing to build
    scenarios programmatically and generate JSON files that can be imported into a project
    of an existing OpenBACH installation.
  * [Auditorium-scripts](auditorium_scripts/README.md): a group of Python scripts equivalent
    to functions described on the [web interface manual][1]. These scripts can be launched
    from the CLI or imported to your own scripts.
  * [Data Access](data_access/README.md): is a Python package used to access data associated
    to the various scenario instances of an OpenBACH platform. Optionally, the data access
    can be used to modify, create, or delete such data.

## Setting up your environment for using executors and API

### Install the API

The tools and scripts that can be found in the folders of the executors and the API can
be used to pilot different OpenBACH platforms. 

To use them, the OpenBACH API should be installed as follows on a machine that has access
to the OpenBACH platforms it wishes to pilot.

The three tools of the OpenBACH API (scenario builder, auditorium-scripts and data-access) are
installed by default on the agents of any OpenBACH platform. You can also install them manually
on other machines by cloning this repository and using the `setup.py` file:

```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools python3-dev build-essential
$ git clone https://github.com/CNES/openbach-extra.git
$ cd openbach-extra/apis/
$ sudo python3 setup.py install
```

### Use your local (modified) version of the API

When developing new scenarios and helpers, you may want to install your latest version of the API
to conduct your tests. Using `python3 setup.py install` to deploy your version as suggested
previously may or may not work depending on your configuration. Here are some tips to get you going:

  * Due to the way Python's import system works, any package installed by `pip` will take priority
    over the same package installed by `setup.py`; so if youâ€™re testing on an agent, you may want
    to `pip uninstall openbach-api` before running `python3 setup.py install`;
  * Alternatively, you can force Python to look into your development folder before anything else
    by using the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable (_e.g._
    `PYTHONPATH=~/openbach-extra/apis/ python3 executor_network_delay.py --arguments... run`);
  * Or you can use [virtual environments][2] to completely separate your system from your test
    environment; once the virtual environment is activated, you can safely `python setup.py install`
    within it to always access your last version when testing (and deactivate it when done).

Once your scenarios/helpers are finished and ready to be committed, you should then modify the
version argument (_e.g._ version='3.1.4') in your [setup.py](setup.py), and commit/push the new
scenarios/helpers as well as the setup.py.

This procedure is also recommended when you want to be sure that you are using the last version
of the scenarios/helpers.

## Description of the controller

Each command must be run using Python 3 and understand the `-h` flag to display the expected
arguments. On top of the positional and optional arguments that are unique for each command,
all have the following arguments needed by the controller:

  * `controller`: the address of the controller to run the command on;
  * `login` or `username`: the name to use to connect as on the controller. If this option is
    provided, the associated password will be asked on the command line when running the command.
    By default, the username and the password are "openbach".

Instead of arguments, you can pass these information by means of a file. For that, it is necessary
to create a JSON file named "controller" (in the folder you will be running scripts from) with the
controller ip, your login and your password, as follows:

``` json
{
    "controller": "192.168.1.3",
    "login": "openbach",
    "password": "openbach"
}
```

In case you don't specify a password, neither on the command-line nor in the `controller` file,
an echo-less prompt will ask it once you run the script.

## A note on PYTHONPATH and the usage of multiple OpenBACH platforms

To ease the use of the auditorium scripts with different OpenBACH platforms, it can be better
to keep a separate "scripting" directory that will host the "controller" file as well. To use
the API scripts, the PATH variable can be changed (in .bashrc for instance or in a particular script): 

```
$ export PATH=$PATH:~/openbach-extra/apis/
```

This way, the commands can be used in any directories. The controller file is searched in the
local directory where your program is launched. 

Do not forget the `PYTHONPATH` variable either in case you didn't install the API system-wide
using `setup.py`. To be able to import the `auditorium_scripts` module from the various scripts, you can: 

```
$ export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:~/openbach-extra/apis/           
```

## A note on proxies

The auditorium scripts make use of a tool that understand the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`
environment variables. If your platform is not accessible through your configured proxy (_e.g._
it is in an internal network), you can deactivate it by temporarily setting the `HTTP_PROXY` variable to `""`:

```
$ cd ~/auditorium-scripts
$ HTTP_PROXY="" ./list_projects.py --controller 192.168.1.3 --login openbach
```
