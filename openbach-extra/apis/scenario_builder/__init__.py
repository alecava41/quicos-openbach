"""OpenBach's Scenarios JSON Builder utilities

This package aims at providing an API to ease programmatic building of
JSON files used to describe and configure a scenario in the OpenBach
framework.

Creation and configuration of various OpenBach functions is done
through objects references rather than manual edition and indexing.
