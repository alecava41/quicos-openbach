It launches 'sr_tunnel' which is a program which implements a Selective Repeat
algorithm at the IP level within a TUN/TAP tunnel. A good illustration of
the algorithm implemented is given here :
https://www2.tkn.tu-berlin.de/teaching/rn/animations/gbn_sr/.

**Important Note** : the traffic needs to be sent to the 'tun0' interfaces in order to
activate the Selective Repeate process.
