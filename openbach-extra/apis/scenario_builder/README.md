# Scenario Builder

The scenario builder is a Python module allowing to build scenarios programmatically in Python
and generate JSON files that can be imported into a project of an existing OpenBACH installation.

Please refer to the [Introduction to OpenBACH-extra and OpenBACH API](/apis/README.md) page to
see how to install and set up your platform to use the API described in this page.

In summary, the scenario builder allows to create a `Scenario` capable of holding, initializing
and configuring the OpenBACH functions:

  *  Start Job Instance
  *  Start Scenario Instance
  *  Stop Job Instance
  *  Stop Scenario Instance
  *  If
  *  While
  *  Push File

## Scenario

### Contruction

An OpenBACH scenario can be built using the `Scenario` class.

You need to provide a name for your scenario, and an optional description:

``` python
DESCRIPTION = """Simple scenario

This simple scenario example aims at showing the capabilities
of the scenario_builder API.
"""
scenario = Scenario('tutorial', DESCRIPTION)
```

### Managing content

You can add or remove arguments, constants or OpenBACH functions to your scenario:

  * Arguments
    ``` python
    scenario.add_argument(argument_name, argument_description)
    scenario.add_arguments(**arguments)
    scenario.remove_argument(argument_name)
    scenario.remove_arguments(*arguments_names)
    ```

    Pretty straightforward, the `add_arguments` version uses keyword arguments as
    `argument_name=argument_description` to call the `add_argument` version.

    Arguments are placeholders that can be used as values for OpenBACH functions whose
    real value won't be known until the scenario is started.

  * Constants
    ``` python
    scenario.add_constant(constant_name, constant_value)
    scenario.add_constants(**constants)
    scenario.remove_constant(constant_name)
    scenario.remove_constants(*constants_names)
    ```

    Similar to arguments, the `add_constants` version uses keyword arguments as
    `constant_name=constant_value` to call the `add_constant` version.

    Constants are placeholders that can be used as values for OpenBACH functions whose
    value is already defined. Useful to factor in values common to several OpenBACH
    functions and change it in a single place if need be.

  * OpenBACH functions
    ``` python
    scenario.add_function(â€¦)
    scenario.remove_function(openbach_function_instance)
    ```

    Defining and configuring OpenBACH functions is explained in details later in this
    guide. Removing OpenBACH functions must be done using the object returned by the
    `add_function` call.

### Exporting to OpenBACH

Once your scenario is ready, you can call the `build` method to get a dictionary representation
of this scenario. This dictionary is suitable to be written in a file as JSON data ready to be
imported into OpenBACH.

``` python
with open('tutorial.json', 'w') as scenario_file:
    json.dump(scenario.build(), scenario_file)
```

As a shortcut, the `write` method does exactly that; so this is equivalent:

``` python
scenario.write('tutorial.json')
```

It is up to you to then send your JSON file to OpenBACH using either the auditorium scripts or the web interface.

### Utilities

The `extract_function_id` method will let you retrieve OpenBACH function's paths from their names.

``` python
scenario.extract_function_id(*job_names, include_subscenarios=False, **filtered_jobs)
```

It is a generator that will yield paths corresponding to all the given `job_names`; these paths
are suitable to use as `jobs` arguments to post-processing jobs, for instance. The keyword
arguments should assign a filtering function to a job name. Once a matching `start_job_instance`
OpenBACH function is found by its name, it is passed as the sole argument to the filtering
function which should return a boolean value indicating if this job should be considered or
not. This allows to discriminate job by their configuration parameters (think `iperf` client
vs. `iperf` server), for instance.

The `find_openbach_function` will return an `OpenBachFunction` instance for one of these paths.

## OpenBACH Functions

### Initialization

In order to initialize the OpenBACH function:

``` python
name_of_function = scenario.add_function(type_of_function, wait_delay=wait_delay, wait_launched=[...], wait_finished=[...])
```

The `type_of_function` is the only mandatory parameter, and the possible values are:
  * `start_job_instance`
  * `stop_scenario_instance`
  * `start_job_instance`
  * `stop_scenario_instance`
  * `if`
  * `while`
  * `push_file`

`wait_launched`, `wait_finished` and `wait_delay` are used for the scheduling conditions (as in
the web interface case):
  * `wait_launched`: a list of other OpenBACH functions that must be completed before this
    one starts (defaults to None);
  * `wait_finished`: a list of other `start_job_instance` or `start_scenario_instance` OpenBACH
    functions; each job/scenario started by these functions must reach completion before this
    function starts (defaults to None);
  * `wait_delay`: an amount of time, in seconds, to wait with respect to the `wait_launched`/`wait_finished`
    functions, before executing its action (defaults to 0.0).

### Configuration

In order to configure an OpenBACH function, you need to call its `configure` method. Each type
of function has its own `configure` parameters:

  * If `start_job_instance`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(job_name, entity_name, offset=0, **parameters_of_job)
    ```

    This function will start the OpenBACH job `job_name` on the agent associated to the
    entity `entity_name` `offset` seconds after the OpenBACH function is scheduled. The
    job will be configured with the values of the parameters provided in the `parameters_of_job`
    keyword arguments.

    Note that when configuring a job whose accept sub-commands, you need to provide a dictionary
    to be able to configure the parameters of the sub-command. Example:
    `iperf3_srv.configure('iperf3', srv_entity, offset=0, interval=1.0, server={'exit':True, 'bind':srv_ip})`.
    If you want to select a sub-command without parameters, provide an empty dictionary to the sub-command
    choice.

  * If `start_scenario_instance`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(scenario_name, **arguments_of_scenario)
    ```

    This function will start the OpenBACH scenario `scenario_name` when it is scheduled. Extra
    arguments provided as keyword arguments will be passed to the launched scenario.

    `scenario_name` can be a string to start an existing scenario in your OpenBACH project; or a
    `Scenario` instance to configure a sub-scenario alongside the one holding this OpenBACH function.

    Note that using a `Scenario` instance will allow you to navigate through them all using the
    `Scenario.subscenarios` iterator on your main scenario. This could help `build`ing them all
    at once, for instance.

  * If `stop_job_instance`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(*functions_to_stop)
    ```

    This function will stop the provided OpenBACH functions as soon as it is scheduled; granted they
    are of type `start_job_instance`.

  * If `stop_scenario_instance`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(scenario_to_stop)
    ```

    This function will stop the provided OpenBACH function as soon as it is scheduled; granted it
    is of type `start_scenario_instance`.

  * If `if`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(condition)
    name_of_function.configure_if_true(*openbach_functions)
    name_of_function.configure_if_false(*openbach_functions)
    ```

    This function will evaluate the `condition` when it is scheduled and launch one or the others
    configured OpenBACH functions depending on the result of this evaluation.

    Note that only the `configure` call is mandatory.

  * If `while`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(condition)
    name_of_function.configure_while_body(*openbach_functions)
    name_of_function.configure_while_end(*openbach_functions)
    ```

    As for the `if` OpenBACH function, only the `configure` call is mandatory. As expected, the
    OpenBACH functions of the body will be executed as long as the condition holds true; the
    `end` functions will always be evaluated once the condition turns false.

  * If `push_file`:
    ``` python
    name_of_function.configure(entity_name, path_on_the_controller, path_on_the_agent, users=(), groups=())
    ```

    When this OpenBACH function is scheduled, the file referenced by `path_on_the_controller` will
    be copied to `path_on_the_agent` on the agent associated to the entity `entity_name`. You can
    provide a single string for each parameters or a list of strings to copy several files at once.
    The length of both lists must match.

    If provided, the `users` and `groups` parameters will control ownership of the files on the
    agent; their length must also match with the other parameters.

## Example

This example creates and returns a scenario containing one argument, `ip_dst`, and three functions:

  * `hping_function`, that starts the job `hping` to ping `$ip_dst`
  * `fping_function`, that starts the job `fping` to ping `$ip_dst`
  * `stop_function`, that stops `hping_function` and `fping_function` 20s after they started

``` python
# Import the Scenario class from scenario_builder
from scenario_builder import Scenario
 
def build_delay_scenario(client, server, scenario_name):
    scenario = Scenario(scenario_name, 'Comparison of 2 types of RTT measurements')
    scenario.add_argument('ip_dst', 'Target of the pings and server ip adress')
 
    hping_function = scenario.add_function('start_job_instance')
    hping_function.configure('hping', client, offset=0, destination_ip='$ip_dst')
    fping_function = scenario.add_function('start_job_instance')
    fping_function.configure('fping', client, offset=0, destination_ip='$ip_dst')
    stop_function = scenario.add_function('stop_job_instance', wait_launched=[hping_function, fping_function], wait_delay=20)
    stop_function.configure(hping_function, fping_function)
    return scenario
```
