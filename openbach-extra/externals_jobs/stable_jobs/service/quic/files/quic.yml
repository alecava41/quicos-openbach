  description: >
      This job runs a client or a server QUIC. Supported QUIC implementations are ngtcp2, picoquic.
      WARNING: quicly is not working, so this implementation is disabled even if installed on the agents. 
      Known that, by default, each implementation is cloned from its standard repository. 
      The installed version is the HEAD of the master branch. If you wish to install another version, 
      you need to modify global variables related to the implementation to change. 
      These variables are located at the begining of the install file of the job. 
      So you have to change the address of the git repository as well as the version to install.
