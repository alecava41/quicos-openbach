== Example 1 ==

Set up a point to point VPN tunnel between a gateway GW and a satellite terminal ST. We consider that this tunnel is built above a satellite link which is emulated using OpenSAND SATCOM emulator. Also GW's subnet (''192.168.42.0/24'' with ''192.168.42.1'' as GW's IP address) and ST's subnet (''192.168.1.0/24'' with ''192.168.1.1'' as ST's IP address) communicate via VPN tunnel.

In the OpenBACH controller web interface, create a scenario and add two start_job_instance function set as follows:
  * For entity GW:
    * **local_ip** = 192.168.42.1
    * **mode** = server
  * For entity ST:
    * **mode** = client
    * **server_ip** = 192.168.42.1

Or launch the job manually

From the GW Agent:
<code>
JOB_NAME=openvpn sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/openvpn/openvpn.py --local-ip 192.168.42.1 server
</code>

From the ST Agent:
<code>
JOB_NAME=openvpn sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/openvpn/openvpn.py client 192.168.42.1
</code>
