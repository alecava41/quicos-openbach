=== Job description ===

This job allows to deploy a ROHC tunnel between two nodes.

=== Example ===

Add a ROHC tunnel between Agent 1 (IP is ''192.168.1.1'') and Agent 2 (IP is ''192.168.1.2''), which compresses only on forward link. The IPv4 tunnel address for ''Agent X'' is ''192.168.2.X'' and the IPv6 tunnel address is ''2001:eeee::X''. It will use large CIDs, 500 contexts, and feedbacks to optimize compression.

== Agent 1 ==

In the web interface, set parameters as follows:
  * **remote_ip** = 192.168.1.2
  * **local_ip** = 192.168.1.1
  * **tunnel_ipv4** = 192.168.2.1
  * **tunnel_ipv6** = 2001:eeee::1
  * **direction** = bidirectional
  * **behavior** = send
  * **cid_type** = largecid
  * **max_contexts** = 500

Or launch the job manually from CLI on the agent as follows:
<code>
JOB_NAME=rohc sudo -E python3 /opt/openbach/agent/jobs/rohc/rohc.py add 192.168.1.2 192.168.1.1 192.168.2.1 2001:eeee::1 -d bidirectional -b send -c largecid -m 500
</code>

== Agent 2 ==

In the web interface, set parameters as follows:
  * **remote_ip** = 192.168.1.1
  * **local_ip** = 192.168.1.2
  * **tunnel_ipv4** = 192.168.2.2
  * **tunnel_ipv6** = 2001:eeee::2
  * **direction** = bidirectional
  * **behavior** = receive
  * **cid_type** = largecid
  * **max_contexts** = 500
