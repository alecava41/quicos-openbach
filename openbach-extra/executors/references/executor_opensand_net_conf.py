#   Agents (one for each network entity that wants to be tested).

"""This executor runs an OpenSAND scenario allowing to:
 - Configure bridge/tap interfaces on entities for OpenSAND to communicate with the real world
 - Configure ip forwarding in case IP mode is requested
 - Clear the configuration if requested
